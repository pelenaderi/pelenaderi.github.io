    <h1>5 facts you need to know about Harry Potter(The books.)!</h1>
    <h2>1. "Lord Voldemort" has a daughter.</h2>
    <img src="voldemort.png" >
    <p>Voldemor's daughter actually pretends to be her "uncles helper and caretacker." But is stopped when Cedric diggorries father(the "uncle".) confesses that he never had a brother or sister in his lifetime. Then, Voldemort's daughter goes back in time with a stolen "time turner" to stop voldemort from attempting to kill Harry Potter in the First book. But luckilly, Harry Potter can still speak parseltoungh and poses for voldemort with a potion cunducted and created by Hermione and save history because of it.  </p>
    <h2>2. Harry Potter's wand is 11" long, is made of holly, and has a pheonix's tail feather in it.</h2>

    <p>But it is'nt just any pheonix feather, it's actually Dumbledore's pheonix's feather. Lord Voldemort got the other one.(Dumbledore's pheonix only gave Olivander 2 feathers.)Because of this, Harry Potter's wand "recongnises" Voldemort's wand and can use a bit of his OWN magic against him.</p>
    <h2>3.  Harry's patronus is a stag</h2>

    <p>In the 3d book, Harry get's attacked by a Dementor during a quidditch match against Huffulpuf, wich leaves him looking for a defence. Luckily, Lupin knowes the patronus charm! After many failed attempts, during a quidditch match, he produces a full-fleged stag-patronus, deafeating the "Dementor." Later, after a bunch of book drama, Harry produces a patronus against a dozen Dementors, deafeats them, and saves Sirius's soul. </p>
    <h2>4. Lupin is a werewolf</h2>

    <p>"Proffesor Lupin" was bitten by Fenrir Greyback when Lupin was only 4 years old. To protect his secret, Dumbledor planted the Womping Willow, with a secret entrance to the "shreiking shack" under it's roots. Every month, he would go to undertake his horrifying transformation under the influence of a potion cunducted by Snape that let's him keep his humanitity.Snape then reveals the truth aboute Lupin, and he resingns. Lupin then joins the order of the pheonix, and well, yeah.</p>
